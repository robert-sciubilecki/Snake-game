This is a snake game. 

This application drew some inspiration from the '100 days of code' 
bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu. However, I authored the code without 
initially referring to the course explanations, resulting in a 
different implementation than what's presented in the bootcamp. 
The implementation I've developed is more advanced and visually appealing.
Moreover, it includes safeguards against many unforeseeable outcomes. 
Though, if you engage in rapid simultaneous pressing of arrow keys, 
the application might still recognize 'GAME OVER' conditions.

It was written using turtle library.
